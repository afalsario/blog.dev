                    <h3>CommonArt</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://commonart-sa.com">CommonArt</a> is a web application for artists in San Antonio to display their art and connect with the community. The web application features a clean user interface for artists where they can easily sign-up and edit a personal profile. We have also made uploading and editing photos and information quick and easy. People interested in local art are then able to search through our artistsâ€™ galleries by keyword, media, or price, and then contact the individual artist for information on items for sale. The application was built using Laravel, PHP, MYSQL, JavaScript, jQuery, and Twitter Bootstrap. Development was done in a Vagrant environment. We implemented version control using Git and GitHub.</p>
